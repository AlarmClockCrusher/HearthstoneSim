# HearthstoneSim
Simulation of Hearthstone game using python (Up to date with Madness at the Darkmoon Faireï¼Œ Nov 2020)

The project is a runnable standard game based on python and includes all cards available in the standard mode (Basic, Classic, Rise of Shadows, Saviors of Uldum, Descent of Dragons, Galakrond's Awakening, Ashes of Outlands, Scholomance Academy, Madness at the Darkmoon Faire)

The card stats are updated according to official patches, such as buffs and nerfs.

To play the game where you control both players' actions:

---1: Install the python and necessary packages (numpy, hearthstone, pillow). For unexperienced Windows user, simply run ConfigureEnvironment.bat, which does these jobs semi-automatically

---2: Run the GUI.py by double clicking it, or run it in Windows command line prompt using py GUI.py
      

Currently working on various optimization of the programs. If you have DIY ideas and would like to see them realized, or want to report bugs, please raise them in the Issues sections.
